AI-assisted iterative development — I develop a full-stack web application (React + .NET 8) using VS Code with an AI coding agent (GitHub Copilot) as a pair-programming partner. The AI agent has full workspace access: it reads code, diagnoses bugs, implements fixes across frontend and backend, runs builds and type-checks, and commits directly to Git. I do UAT testing on the deployed app, report issues in plain language, and the agent investigates root causes, writes the fix, and pushes to GitHub — where CI/CD auto-deploys to Azure. This creates a tight feedback loop: test → report → fix → deploy → retest, often completing multiple bug fixes in a single session.

The process is great. I would like to speed it up.

Current bottlenecks.
When I am testing I am finding bugs or feature requirements faster than a fix can be developed resoved and deployed.
We are deploying too often we should create a branch for each bug or feature assign an agent to each branch and then merge and deploy together in batches when ready
In vs code it does not work well to have more than one agent working at a time (that may be a user issue)

Idea
Create an application where multiple testers can work and record their requests in a structured way


The request is then sent to gitub 'Product owner' agent with access to code base
--Product Owner Agent 
--Checks the request and posts clarification questions to get more information if required
--Checks that the request is in line with the objectives of the application (is this in line with what the application was designed to do)
--Checks if the request is in line with the product sales pack (will it enhance our sales pack)
--If the product owner approves it is sent to Architect agent to develop a solution
--Status of request is updated
The Architect agent then
--Reviews the request considers the current codebase and recommends a 
--Solution
--Impact (what is impact, do we need to fix migrate data etc)
--Status updated
--Send for Approval
Human Review
--Review suggested solution
--Ask agent question
--Agent may make changes as required
--Human review and architect agree solution
--Human approves
Planning Agent 
--Picks up approved Tasks 
--Creates a new branch
--Assigns them to implementation agent
--Monitors progress
--Merges Braches
--triggers deploy to UAT
--updates status
